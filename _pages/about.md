Hi! My name is Ali Fele Paranj and I am a master's student in mathematics at UBC, Vancouver, Canada. I have studied physics (2016-2021) for my undergraduate @ Sharif University of Techonology (Tehran, Iran). I also have a master's degree in engineering (biomedical engineering) form UBC (2021-2023).

My main research interests are in optmimal transport, stochastic processes, statistical physics, and numerical analysis, coding (and extra coding! (and extra coding! (...))). Apart from my research, I spend my free time with some cool projects with embedded systems and analog electronic (see --- for a list of my project), or trying to make some basic games with pygame (in python) or SFML (in CPP).

I have also been systematically writing some lecture notes (for the courses that I tool or self-study) and solution manuals. See ---- for more details.

I enjoy listening to traditional persian Avaz (MohammedReza/Homayoun Shajarian, and Banan) and also Tar/Setar/Kamancheh/Ney (Shahnaz, Sharif, Lotfi, Kalhor, Andalibi). I am learning to play Tar/Setar, and also very interested in playing Piano.
