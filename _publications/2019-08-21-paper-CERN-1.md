This was my very first experience for a real scientific research. In this project, I simulated an electromagnetic trap used to confine anti-matter (positron and anti-proton) particles. Furthermore, I helped in designing a Virtual Instrument Interface used to control the positron accumulator. The time I spent at CERN was one of the best periods of my life. Thanks to my supervisor Dr. Muhammed Sameed for his great help.
