After my succesful experience at CERN as a summer student (2019), I continued doing a remote project with him on the optimization of a critical instrument that enabled the research group to increase the efficiency of the anti-matter trapping. This increased efficiency increases the amount of anti-matter produced and traped, that enables more delicate measurements like the interactoin of the anti-matter with gravity.
