This paper came out of my master's thesis project for my degree in biomedical engineering (2021-2023 UBC). In this paper we used the tools from systems biology to model the kinetics of radiopharmaceuticals in the body to optimize radipharmaceutical therapy. In short, radiopharmaceutical therapy is the method of using some peptides labeled with radioisotopes to inject in the body and target some recepters on tumors and deliver radiation to tumor.
