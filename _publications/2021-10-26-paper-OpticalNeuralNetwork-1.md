excerpt: 'This is one of my favourite papers. I did an atomic simulation of an optical element to be used as the source of non-linearity in an optical neural network where it acts somehow like an activation function.'

This is one of the coolest projects I have involved in. For this paper, I did an atomic simulation of an optical element called Saturable Absorber or "SA" in short. The optical absorbtion of this element saturates under high intensity and this property can be utilized to be used as an nonlinear element in the optical neural networks (neural networks that are implemented with a 4f optical system). Optical neural network is a physical implementation of a CNN netowrk where the convlution is implemented by multiplying two images in the fourier space that is achieved using the optical 4F systems.'
